	       menu of the object.

	     - Not all slotvalues will be updated in the graph window,

	       o For replacing model, in the current graph window:

                 "overwrite = TRUE, addModel = TRUE,
                  frameModels = Args$frameModels, 
                  frameViews = Args$frameViews, 
                  graphWindow = Args$graphWindow, ..."

               EssentialViewProto-class, 

	     - New view types can be defined,

	       o Argument viewClasses = validViewClasses() 
	         of dynamicGraphMain

	     - For "communicating" the model between views:

	       o The method "returnGraphComponents" of the model object
	         for returning the objects to draw in the view, 
	         depending on the viewType.

	       o The method "setGraphComponents" of the model object
	         is called on the model object when the model is modified.

	     - Example "3.R" added

 
 2004-08-29: Edge class added:


	     - New edge types can be defined,

	       o Argument edgeClasses = validEdgeClasses()

		 with coordinates at the middle of the two vertices

 2004-08-28: Fix: More factor- or extra-vertices than vertices gave
		  invalid index

             down while left or right clicking edge:

             - selectedEdges to modifyModel,

 2004-01-18: New feature: Edges (from, to and edge.list), factors,
                          blocks and block.tree for DynamicGraph can

 2004-01-18: Bug at more than one CoCo-object: 
             .current.coco replaced by object = object in make.model
             at  my.assign(".current.coco.model", .new.coco.model( ...))
