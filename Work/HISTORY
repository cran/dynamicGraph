             in setTreeBlocks

 2004-02-03: If no vertices in the block, then do not try to position them

 2004-02-01: CoCo: Methods testLabel and testWidth now label(... and width(...

 2004-02-01: dynamicGraph: Call to methods
             (edgeLabel,   edgeWidth,   testLabel   and testWidth )
              labelOfEdge, widthOfEdge, labelOfTest and widthOfTest,
             now label(... and width(...

 2004-02-01: CoCo: Call to methods testLabel and testWidth
             now label(... and width(...

 2004-02-01: Strata and block indices separated: slot blockindex
             added to VertexProto

 2004-01-31: Curser, open block label: "diamond_cross" -> "left_ptr"
                     open block:       "cross_reverse" -> "right_ptr"

 2004-01-31: Highlighting of extra vertices disabled.

 2004-01-31: Extra vertices are also returned in graph@ (canvas).

 2004-01-31: Slave graphs appear with blocks opened or closed as in
             calling window.

 2004-01-31: Tree argument to SetTreeBlock now has @closed for blocks,
             and blocks are drawn accordingly. (Slot "closed" and
             methods "closed(<-)" added to BlockProto, and
             methods "Closed" added to list-class.

 2004-01-31: Sub block of a closed block will appear again
             as when the block was closed.

 2004-01-30: Change of names dummyVertices and dummyVisualVertices.

 2004-01-30: factorVertices added to CanvasProto

 2004-01-30: Change of vertexIndices to nodeIndices for only factors

 2004-01-28: edgeLabel,   edgeWidth,   testLabel   and testWidth now
             labelOfEdge, widthOfEdge, labelOfTest and widthOfTest, ...

 2004-01-24: Extract function for vertex-, edge- and block-list
             replaced of methods for class "list".

 2004-01-23: Argument objectName = "" added.

 2004-01-23: Argument namesOnEdges = TRUE added.

 2004-01-23: Argument updateEdgeLabels = TRUE added.

 2004-01-18: Fix of minor bug (moveBlock): Edges not move double,
             now not move of blocks relative upper-left corner.

 2004-01-18: Fix of minor bug (update of block edges missing when 
             vertex not opened/closed) / made more efficient: 
             Update of blockedges move to setCloseBlock.

 2004-01-18: New feature: Check for invalid names (and indices) in
                          edges (from, to and edge.list), factors,
                          blocks and block.tree for DynamicGraph.

 2004-01-18: New feature: Edges (from, to and edge.list), factors,
                          blocks and block.tree for DynamicGraph can
                          now be names on vertices.

 2004-01-18: Bug at more than one CoCo-object: 
             .current.coco replaced by object = object in make.model
             at  my.assign(".current.coco.model", .new.coco.model( ...))
