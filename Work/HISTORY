 2004-01-30: Change of names dummyVertices and dummyVisualVertices.

 2004-01-30: factorVertices added to CanvasProto

 2004-01-30: Change of vertexIndices to nodeIndices for only factors

 2004-01-28: edgeLabel, edgeWidth, testLabel and testWidth now
             labelOfEdge, ...

 2004-01-24: Extract function for vertex-, edge- and block-list
             replaced of methods for class "list".

 2004-01-23: Argument objectName = "" added.

 2004-01-23: Argument namesOnEdges = TRUE added.

 2004-01-23: Argument updateEdgeLabels = TRUE added.

 2004-01-18: Fix of minor bug (moveBlock): Edges not move double,
             now not move of blocks relative upper-left corner.

 2004-01-18: Fix of minor bug (update of block edges missing when 
             vertex not opened/closed) / made more efficient: 
             Update of blockedges move to setCloseBlock.

 2004-01-18: New feature: Check for invalid names (and indices) in
                          edges (from, to and edge.list), factors,
                          blocks and block.tree for DynamicGraph.

 2004-01-18: New feature: Edges (from, to and edge.list), factors,
                          blocks and block.tree for DynamicGraph can
                          now be names on vertices.

 2004-01-18: Bug at more than one CoCo-object: 
             .current.coco replaced by object = object in make.model
             at  my.assign(".current.coco.model", .new.coco.model( ...))
